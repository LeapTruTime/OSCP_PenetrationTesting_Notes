-----------========= Linux ========----------

Display strings of a file eg. a binary file or an image

strings <filename>
strings stegano.jpg
strings /dev/sdb
strings winfile.exe | grep -i pass

strings -e b <filename>
strings -e s <filename>
strings -e l <filename>

binwalk <filename>


Extracting hidden files from the actual file

steghide extract -sf <filename>
steghide extract -sf stegano.jpg


Hexeditor:

xxd <filename>
xxd /dev/sdb


Grep something from a binary file (e.g. a flag or sth in a deleted file on a device)
-> grep a flag from a deleted file on device /sdb

grep -a '[a-z0-9]\{32\}' /dev/sdb


Adding lines before and after the grep line using -B<n> and -A<n> (e.g. to recover the entire deleted files from a device)

grep -B2 -A2 -a '[a-z0-9]\{32\}' /dev/sdb





======= Arcives and compressed files

Cracking the password of a zip file:
Getting the password hash

zip2john BHWS_Backup.zip


Storing the hash in a file and use john to crack it

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt bhws.encr


Extract the files providing the cracked password

7z x BHWS_Backup.zip

======= File META Data

Inspect Meta Date of a file

exiftool Presentation.pdf

======= disk images

show disks

df -lh


creating disk images:

dd


enhanced forensic version of dd:

dcfldd
dcfldd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/media/disk/test_image.dd


Creating and transferring a ziped disc image via ssh to the local computer:

ssh pi@10.10.10.48 "sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb | gzip -1 -" | dcfldd of=dev_sdb_output.dd.gz


Extracting the file

gunzip -d dev_sdb_output.dd.gz


Image inspection

binwalk dev_sdb_output.dd


Using -Me to extract the files from the image

binwalk -Me dev_sdb_output.dd


Inspect the image and extract single or group of files or recover deleted files

testdisk dev_sdb_output.dd

photorec dev_sdb_output.dd

======= Decrypt luks encrypted file
Get the Payload offset:

sudo cryptsetup luksDump backup.img


Get the header hash, where count is the offset value:

dd if=backup.img of=luks-header bs=512 count=4097


Use the haeaderfile to crack the password using hashcat:

hashcat -m 14600 luks-header /opt/wordlist/rockyou.txt


Decrypt the file

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen backup.img decrypted


Mount the file

ls /dev/mapper

sudo mount /dev/mapper/decrypted /mnt
